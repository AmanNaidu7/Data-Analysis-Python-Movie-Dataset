# PythonMovieDataSet

In this project, I analyse a dataset concerning imbd movies.  The posed question of interest is:
Which genres are most popular from year to year?  Has this changed over time?

Details about the process can found in the .pdf file.

Details about the code used by found in the .py file

All analysis is done in python.
